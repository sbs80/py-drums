## Snare Synthesizer

Snare.ipynb

A simple snare drum synthesizer written in Python. Its parameters can either be tuned by hand or machine learnt by matching to an uploaded sample file using a genetic algorithm.

The synthesizer is loosely based on the technique described in this article: https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/synthesizing-drums-snare-drum.

The genetic algorithm is adapted from the following guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/genetic-algorithm-implementation-in-python-5ab67bb124a6. This has since been expanded to make a Python library PyGAD https://pypi.org/project/pygad.
