## Snare Synthesizer

Snare.ipynb

A simple snare drum synthesizer written in Python with automatic parameter matching. A genetic algorithm is used to tune the synthesizer parameters in an attempt to match the output to an uploaded audio file.

The synthesizer is loosely based on the technique described in this article: https://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/synthesizing-drums-snare-drum.

The genetic algorithm is adapted from the following guide: https://towardsdatascience.com/genetic-algorithm-implementation-in-python-5ab67bb124a6. This has since been expanded to make a Python library PyGAD https://pypi.org/project/pygad.
